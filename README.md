# Full-Stack App Spread

## Introduction
#

Recently I've been exploring many new web technologies, frameworks, and methods. I couldn't find a "one fits all" meta framework, so I'll be making random full stack applications in this repository. 

There will be many types of web tech being used, to hopefully find what out what I enjoy.

The 4 main criterion will be: (1-5)

- Developer Experience (DX)
- Performance
- Time To Ship
- Community/Popularity
- Functionality & Sustainability

*The Readme will contain a breakdown of each stack's ratings.*

#

## The [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/)

This one is definitely the most trendy. It's a opt-in boostrap for the full stack ecosystem containing:

- TypeScript
- Next.js
- Prisma ORM
- tRPC
- NextAuth.js
- Tailwind CSS
