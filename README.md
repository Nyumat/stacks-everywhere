# Stacks, everywhere.

## Introduction
#

Recently I've been exploring many new web technologies, frameworks, and methods. I couldn't find a "one fits all" meta framework, so I'll be making random full stack applications in this repository. 

There will be many types of web tech being used, to hopefully find what out what I enjoy.

The 4 main criterion will be: (1-5)

- Developer Experience (DX)
- Performance
- Time To Ship
- Community/Popularity
- Functionality & Sustainability

*The Readme will contain a breakdown of each stack's ratings.*
 
#

## The [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/)

This one is definitely the most trendy. It's a opt-in boostrap for the full stack ecosystem containing:

- TypeScript
- Next.js
- Prisma ORM
- PostgreSQL
- tRPC
- NextAuth.js
- Tailwind CSS

### Ratings

- Developer Experience (DX): **5/5**
- Performance: **3/5**
- Time To Ship: **1/5**
- Community/Popularity: **2.5/5**
- Functionality & Sustainability: **4.5/5**

Overall I *really* liked this stack. 

The great thing here with T3 is the end-to-end type safety that you get wit tRPC, Prisma, and TypeScript. Truly gamechanging. However, this ofc does add to the TTS.

## The [MERN Stack](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack)

MERN has to be the ol' faithful on this list. Whenever I need a quick app shipped, I don't hesistate to use this stack.

- MongoDB
- Express.js
- Plain React.js 
- Node.js

### Ratings

- Developer Experience (DX): **2.5/5**
- Performance: **1.5/5**
- Time To Ship: **5/5**
- Community/Popularity: **5/5**
- Functionality & Sustainability: **4.5/5**

I *adore* this stack. I have the most experience with it, and I love how it doesn't "give" you anything. 

I pick the router, I pick the styling solution, I pick the data fetching strategy. The one thing I will say though, is this stack is un-opionated to a a...crux?

## The [SvelteKit Stack](https://kit.svelte.dev/)

I have been fascinated with what Rich Harris has done with Svelte and now SvelteKit for some time now.

It's awesome to know that there's frameworks for people who don't want to deal with JSX. I love that when writing svelte code, everything simply feels like magic.

- Svelte
- TypeScript + ESLint
- SvelteKit
- Vite

### Ratings

- Developer Experience (DX): **5/5**
- Performance: **5/5**
- Time To Ship: **5/5**
- Community/Popularity: **3.5/5**
- Functionality & Sustainability: **4./5**

I didn't even need to do anything post install because the demo app 'Sverdle' is so good that it doesn't deseerve modification. Can't wait to see the future of Svelte.
